    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to the world of JavaScript!</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It allows you to create dynamic content, manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user actions, and much more.</p>

    <p>Here are some key features of JavaScript:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Client-side scripting language: JavaScript runs on the client side (i.e., in the web browser), enabling dynamic updates to the content and behavior of web pages without requiring a page reload.</li>
        <li>Object-oriented: JavaScript is an object-oriented language, which means it uses objects and their properties to represent and manipulate data.</li>
        <li>Event-driven programming: JavaScript allows you to define actions or functions that are executed in response to certain events, such as user clicks, mouse movements, or keyboard inputs.</li>
        <li>Platform-independent: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and can run on any platform, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To include JavaScript code in your HTML document, you can use the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Here's an example:</p>
    
    <pre><code>
&lt;script&gt;
    // JavaScript code goes here
&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>You can place the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section of your HTML document. When placed in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, the script will be loaded before the page content, while placing it in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> allows the content to load first, improving performance.</p>

    <p>Now that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, you're ready to start exploring its capabilities and building interactive web applications!</p>

    <p>Happy coding!</p>



    <script>
        alert("Welcome to Javascript");
